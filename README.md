# Space-Invaders

Inspired by ania kubow's tutorial

A vanilla JavaScript game with HTML and CSS

Space Invaders is a simple grid-based game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. We are going to build a 15 x 15 grid square with 20 invaders to shoot.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on for loops and classLists in JavaScript. If you want to learn how to use these loops and classLists effectively, please have a look at ania kubow's code.

# We are also going to be looking at:

* for loops
* addEventListener
* classList
* document.querySelector
* Timeout
* switch case

As always I have kept the styling at a bare minimum for you to go wild and make it your own.
